# DemoWiz

This project is a web based video editor built entirely in the browser, designed for speed, flexibility, and modern workflows. It uses **WebCodecs** to provide core multimedia processing directly in the client.

---

## Overview

The editor allows users to load, edit, and manipulate video files directly in the browser without uploading them to a server. This ensures:

- Low-latency editing
- High privacy
- Fully offline capability (after initial load)
- No server costs for video processing
